			<h2>What is a Framework?</h2>

				<p>
				Frameworks make the development process easy with fewer errors. It is a general template that can be used and modified as per the requirement. It will be easy for others to understand your code as they are also familiar with frameworks.</p>

							<ul>

									<li>Frameworks provide many advantages such as:</li>
									<li>Easy to test your code and debug it.</li>
									<li>Clean code is much easy to understand and work with.</li>
									<li>Reduces redundancy of code in the project.</li>
									<li>Reduces the time and cost of the project with the enhanced application.</li>
									<li>Features and functionalities provided by the framework can be modified and extended.</li>


							</ul>


				<h3>Types of Frameworks</h3>

				<p>Before starting with the development process, you need to choose which programming language will be suitable for your project. For example, if you choose <strong>JavaScript</strong>, then you need to research the JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, Next.js, Vue.js, etc and decide which frameworks are suitable for your project.</p>

				<p>Each framework provides a rich set of features and functionalities. These frameworks can be used in software development (web and mobile applications) and the data science field. It is important to know your requirements clearly and then start working with the frameworks according to your requirements.</p>

				<h3>Web Development Frameworks</h3>

				<p>Web development refers to developing and maintaining websites and web applications. It can be a single web page, either a static or dynamic website or a web application. Web development frameworks are used in the development of websites and web applications by serving web resources, web services, and <b>APIs</b> to developers. The web development frameworks can be divided into two: <strong>Front-end frameworks</strong> and <strong>Back-end frameworks.</strong> </p>

				<h3>A. Front-End Frameworks</h3>

				<p>Frontend web development frameworks are used to create the user interface of the website that is seen and used by the users. They develop the client side of the application. Some of the popular <strong>front-end</strong> web development frameworks are Angular and Vue.js.</p>

				<h4>1. Angular</h4>

				<p><strong>Angular</strong> is an open-source <b>TypeScript</b>-based framework developed by Google for building dynamic websites and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). It offers fast performance, easy integration with third-party tools, and efficient code handling. Top companies using Angular include Google, PayPal, Nike, and Upwork.</p>

				<h4>2. VueJS</h4>

				<p><strong>Vue.js</strong> is an open-source JavaScript-based frontend web development framework. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and supports Model-View-View Model (MVVM) architecture. It is easy to learn and understand and has large community support. Many top companies use the Vue.js framework such as Behance, Trustpilot, etc.</p>

				<h4>3. Bootstrap</h4>

				<p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> is an open-source CSS framework built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables fast, responsive, and cross-platform web development. Many leading companies, including Airbnb, Netflix, and Uber, use Bootstrap.</p>

				<h3>B. Back-End Frameworks</h3>

				<p>Backend web development frameworks are used on the server side of the application. They provide backend functionalities responsible for handling requests, databases, communicating with APIs, etc. Some of the popular backend web development frameworks are Ruby on Rails, Django, PHP, etc.</p>

				<h4>1. Ruby on Rails</h4>

				<p><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> is an open-source Ruby-based framework. Ruby is responsible for providing secure and scalable software. It is based on Model View Controller (MVC) architecture and third-party libraries can also be integrated. There are many top companies that make use of the Ruby on Rails framework such as CafePress, Airbnb, etc.</p>

				<h4>2. Django</h4>

				<p><strong>Django</strong> is an open-source Python-based web framework. It provides a speedy development of web applications and ensures that they are scalable and flexible. Django is based on Model Template View (MTV) architecture and is compatible with any frontend framework. There are many top companies that make use of Django such as YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, etc.</p>

				<h4>3. Spring Boot</h4>

				<p><strong>Spring Boot</strong> is an open-source Java-based web framework. It enables developers to develop production-ready and standalone applications. Spring Boot provides high flexibility and scalability to websites. Many top companies use Spring Boot such as Netflix, Uber, Intuit, LinkedIn, etc.</p>

				<h3>C. Mobile Application Framework</h3>

				<p>Mobile application frameworks are used to develop mobile applications for both Android and iOS. These applications can be either native, hybrid, or cross-platform as per the requirements. Some of the best frameworks for mobile app development are Flutter, React Native, and Ionic.</p>

				<h4>1. Flutter</h4>

				<p><strong>Flutter</strong> is an open-source mobile application framework developed and maintained by Google. It works with Dart programming language to create cross-platform applications compatible with Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop. Flutter is used by many top companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, Adobe, etc.</p>

				<h4>2. React Native</h4>

				<p><strong>React Native</strong> is an open-source JavaScript framework created and maintained by Meta. React Native can be used to develop applications that are compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, Web, and Windows. React Native is used by many top companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Skype, Tesla, etc.</p>

				<h3>D. Data Science Frameworks</h3>

				<p>Data Science is a field that collects data from various sources and then analyses them by applying various algorithms and statistics. Majorly, data scientists work with Python language hence many Python frameworks are used in data science:</p>

				<h4>1. PyTorch</h4>

				<p><strong>PyTorch</strong> is an open-source data science framework based on Python and Torch library. It is used to create deep learning models and develop artificial neural networks. PyTorch is also used in Natural Language Processing (<b>NLP</b>), image classification, object and obstacle detection, etc.</p>

				<h4>2. Apache Spark</h4>

				<h3><strong>Apache Spark</strong> is an open-source framework that is used in big data analytics. It supports various programming languages such as Scala, R, <b>Python</b>, and <b>Java</b> and is hence widely used by data scientists. Apache Spark processes real-time streams used in machine learning, analyses of large amounts of data, and predictive analytics.</h3>

				<h3>E. Other Frameworks</h3>

				<p>In addition to the frameworks mentioned above, there are other specialized frameworks tailored for specific technologies and use cases. These frameworks cater to various development needs, from game development to machine learning and beyond. Below are some notable technologies and their associated frameworks:</p>

				<h3>Game Development</h3>

							<ul>


								<li><strong>Unity</strong> - For creating 2D/3D games and VR experiences across platforms like mobile, PC, and consoles, used by Ubisoft and Niantic.</li>
								<li><strong>Unreal Engine</strong> - For high-fidelity AAA games, VR, and simulations, used by Epic Games and Square Enix.</li>

							</ul>

				<h3>Machine Learning</h3>

							<ul>

								<li><strong>TensorFlow</strong> - For building and deploying machine learning models for tasks like image recognition and NLP, used by Google and Airbnb.</li>
								<li><strong>Scikit-learn</strong> - For data analysis and machine learning tasks like classification and regression.</li>

							</ul>

				<h3>Desktop Application Development</h3>

							<ul>

								<li><strong>Electron</strong> - For cross-platform desktop apps, powering apps like Visual Studio Code and Slack.</li>
								<li><strong>Qt</strong> - For high-performance desktop, embedded, and mobile apps with native interfaces, used by Autodesk.</li>

							</ul>

				<h3>API Development</h3>

							<ul>

								<li><strong>FastAPI</strong> - For building high-performance APIs with automatic validation, used by Microsoft and Uber.</li>
